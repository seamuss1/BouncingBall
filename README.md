# BouncingBall

This is a physics simulator module intented to be used with Cortix. Each bouncing ball object follows the same physics, but the starting position and velocity are randomized. 

To get started:

`pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`

Shapely is dependent on the GEOS library

`sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev`

Start the program by running `bouncingball_cortix.py` and following the directions given by the text interface.
