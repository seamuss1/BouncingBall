# Bouncing Balls

Getting started:

`pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`


Shapely is dependent on the GEOS C library:

`sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev`

Start the program by running `bouncingball_cortix.py` and follow the instructions given by the text interface. Once completed, it will output an mp4 file that contains the simulation results.


Note: Bouncing Ball is still under active development
